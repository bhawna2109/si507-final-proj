            <h2>Welcome to Bhawna Agarwal's SI507 final project.</h2>

            This is a tool that'll help you finalize the next book that you should read and provide you with an option to preview the book.
            <br><br>To proceed, we will need you to create a secrets.py so that you can access goodreads API. This should look like:
            <br>GOODREADS_API_KEY = 'YourAPIKey'
            <br>GOODREADS_API_SECRET = 'YourAPISecret'
            <br><br><br>
      </div>
      <form action="/handle_form" method="POST">
            <p>
                  What's your <strong>GoodreadsID?</strong> This is the number that shows up in the URL when you go to the My Books tab in your goodreads profile. <input name="GoodreadsID" type="text"/><br/><br/><br/>
            </p>
            <input type="submit" value="Submit Goodreads ID"/>
      </form>
